# Fourier Transform
This work was made for a university oral examination. We can find in:
* Discret Fourier transform 2D
* Discret inverse Fourier transform 2D
* Fast Fourier transform 2D
* Fast inverse Fourier Transform 2D

The n-th roots are calculated with **cmath** module. Therefore, the results are approximations (10 ^ (- 16) instead of 0).
